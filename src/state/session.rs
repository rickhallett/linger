//! here; the graph layer ([`AgentFlow`](crate::state::AgentFlow)) projects this onto a `Flow`.
//!
//! Node ids are stable strings: `"main"` for the root agent, and otherwise
//! whatever id the provider stated the agent under (Claude's 17-hex agent id,
//! Codex's thread id, a group's own id). Spawn order is tracked explicitly so
