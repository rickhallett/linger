//! The provider boundary: what a transcript *says*, stripped of how it said it.
//!
//! A provider turns its own wire format (Claude's JSONL entries, Codex's
//! rollout records) into a stream of [`Fact`]s. [`SessionModel`] folds facts and
//! knows nothing about either format. The rule that keeps this honest, and the
//! reason the vocabulary is this small:
//!
//! > A provider states what its records contain. The core decides what it means
//! > when nothing was recorded.
//!
//! So a provider never concludes. It does not decide an agent is done because a
//! tool result came back (that is a [`FactKind::ToolEnd`]; whether it doubles
//! as a spawn acknowledgement is a join the core makes, and the core knows an
//! acknowledgement is not a completion); it does not invent an outcome for a
//! record that carries none (it emits no `ToolEnd`, and the call stays pending,
//! which is ground truth that the agent is working). Reasoning about absence
//! lives in one place, `SessionModel`, and survives both formats.
//!
//! Every fact carries the same envelope: which agent it is about and when. That
//! is what lets the fold track activity once instead of per record kind, and
//! what lets the timeline date undated facts (see `tailer::item::Timing`) without
//! knowing any format. Facts travel in [`Statement`]s, one per record read:
//! the record's own time places it on the timeline, each fact's time feeds
//! the fold.
//!
//! [`SessionModel`]: crate::state::session::SessionModel
