// The README is the crate's front page on docs.rs as well as on crates.io: this
// is an application, so what a reader needs first is what zoetrope does, not the

// library rather than running the binary.

//! ## The library
//!
//! The portable core behind both the native frontend
//! (the `zoe` terminal app, `src/main.rs`) and the browser frontend (the
//! `zoetrope-web` crate at `web/wasm/`, which depends on this one with default
//! features off).
//!
//! Portable everywhere: the domain [`state`] (model + unified replay/live
//! [`timeline`](state::Timeline) + flow-graph projection), the [`ui`] rendering,
//! the [`fact`] vocabulary every transcript format is reduced to, and the
//! [`provider`] providers that do the reducing. The wire types and pure replay
//! assembly live in [`tailer`]; its live file-tailing + the terminal loop ([`tui`]) and input
//! ([`handler`]) are native-only (they pull tokio/crossterm/fs) and `cfg`-gated
//! behind the `native` feature.

// interface to build on: they may change shape in any release. The parts meant
// to be depended on are the domain and the vocabulary above.
